## About The Project

The primary goal of this project was to build a static website using HTML5 and CSS3, putting fundamental web development principles into practice. The development process was a blend of guided walkthroughs provided by Code Institute and self-guided challenges that required independent research and problem-solving. This approach was instrumental in building a solid foundation in front-end development and professional developer workflows.

A key focus throughout the project was adhering to a professional Git workflow. As you can see from the commit history, work was organized into distinct, well-documented commits, reflecting an industry-standard approach to version control.
